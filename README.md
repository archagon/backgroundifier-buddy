A menu bar companion to my [Backgroundifier](http://backgroundifier.archagon.net) image conversion app. Helps turn your Mac desktop into a cycling art gallery.

Intended features:

* Cycle image
* Get filename of current image
* Delete current image
* Archive current image

"Previous image" would be nice, but would require changing the system wallapper database file, which would not be good. Author/title display would also be nice, but would require the images to have metadata, which is unlikely.
